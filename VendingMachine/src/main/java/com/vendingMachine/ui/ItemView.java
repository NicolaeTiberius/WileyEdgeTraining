    /**THIS METHOD WILL BE TAKING IN THE NAME OF THE PRODUCT AND THE AMOUNT THE USER HAS INPUTTED TO PURCHASE IT.
     Then a try catch method will be run for exception handling if they select an item that is out of stock or don't
     have enough money to purchase it.

     Afterwards a loop will iterate over the entire item arraylist and check if the product name exists,
     then a getter is used to retrieve the price of the product so it can be used to calculate the change

     There is a lot of checking over in this function;

     1.If the user has enough money to pay but the item is not in stock then an exception will be provoked and caught later that will
     let the user know that the item is out of stock and cannot be purchased.

     2.If the user hasn't got enough money to pay for the item then another exception will be thrown that will let the user know
     that they have insufficient funds and their amount is returned so they can start again.

     3.If the user has enough money and the item is not out of stock then it will convert their amount to bigdecimal first to carry out the
     com.vendingMachine.dto.Change Function which will calculate how many COINS are needed to be returned back to the user from the remainder that they have left.
     The remainder will simply be calculated by substracting the itemPrice from userAmount and that amount will be used in the change function
     to return the correct amount of number.
